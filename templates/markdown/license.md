### 2. License Grant, Acceptance, Trial & Commercial

2.1 By installing, copying, accessing, or using the Software, you accept this SPQRK License. If you do not agree, do not install or use the Software. The Software is licensed, not sold.

2.2 **Trial License.** Licensor grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Software during the 14-day Trial Period, per Seat, free of charge, solely to evaluate the Software for your personal or internal business purposes.

2.3 After the Trial Period for a Seat ends, that Seat must either purchase a commercial license for the Software through an Official Purchase Channel or cease all use of the Software for that Seat.

2.4 **Commercial License (Per-Seat).** Upon valid purchase of a Seat through an Official Purchase Channel and subject to this License, Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable (except as in Section 3.3), worldwide license for that Seat to:

* install and use the Software on any number of devices used by the named Seat; and
* use the Software for personal or internal business purposes.

2.5 **Lifetime & Upgrades.** The license for each Seat is lifetime and includes all future updates and Versions of the Software made available by Licensor to the public, **subject to** the following:

* Licensor may designate a future **Major Version** as a separate product requiring a new license (for example, from Version 2.x to 3.0); and
* if you do not purchase such new Major Version, your existing license remains valid for the latest Version you are then entitled to use.

2.6 **No Keys, Proof of Purchase.** The Software does not use license keys, online activation, or tracking. Your Proof of Purchase for the relevant Seats is your evidence of a valid license. You are responsible for keeping Proof of Purchase and for complying with Seat limits and other terms of this License.

### 3. Seats, Use, Transfers & Hosted Use

3.1 Each Seat must correspond to one natural person. Multiple people may not share a Seat.

3.2 A Seat holder may use the Software on any number of devices they personally use.

3.3 A Seat may be reassigned (transferred) to a different person (for example, when an employee leaves), provided that the previous holder permanently ceases all use of the Software.

3.4 You may run the Software on your own infrastructure (including company servers or virtual machines) for the benefit of licensed Seats.

3.5 If you provide the Software as a hosted or managed service to others, each human end user who directly interacts with the Software’s user interface must hold a valid Seat, unless Licensor agrees otherwise in writing. People who only view or use content created with the help of the Software do not need a Seat.

### 4. Source Code, Modifications & Contributions

4.1 The Software’s source code may be made available (for example, via GitHub) for transparency and collaboration.

4.2 You may view the source code and, for licensed Seats, modify it for your own internal use only.

4.3 You may not distribute, publish, or resell the Software (original or modified), in source or binary form, except with Licensor’s prior written consent. Availability of source code does not grant any rights beyond those expressly stated in this License.

4.4 If you provide feedback, suggestions, or code modifications (including pull requests) to Licensor, you grant Licensor a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use, modify, incorporate, distribute, and sublicense such feedback or modifications in any form and for any purpose, without obligation to you.

### 5. Restrictions

You shall not, and shall not permit others to:

* use the Software for any Seat after that Seat’s Trial Period ends without a paid license;
* redistribute, sell, sublicense, rent, lease, or lend the Software, in source or binary form, original or modified, except as expressly allowed by Licensor in writing;
* remove or alter any proprietary notices or attribution in the Software;
* falsify, forge, or misrepresent Proof of Purchase or the number of Seats you are licensed for;
* use the Software to develop a directly competing product.

This License relies in part on honest compliance; there is no technical enforcement, but the obligations remain legally binding.

### 6. Updates & Third-Party Components

6.1 Licensor may provide updates, bug fixes, or improvements from time to time. Unless expressly stated otherwise, such releases made available to the public are covered by Section 2.5. Licensor is not obligated to provide new features, enhancements, or support, except as it chooses.

6.2 The Software includes third-party components that are licensed under their own terms (for example, MIT-, BSD-, or Apache-style licenses). Copies of these licenses are provided in the distribution or repository. Nothing in this License limits your rights under the applicable third-party licenses. To the extent of any conflict between this License and a third-party license, the third-party license governs your use of that specific component.

7.2 **Limitation of Liability.** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE OR THIS LICENSE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

8.6 You may not assign or transfer this License (other than reassigning Seats as permitted in Section 3.3) without Licensor’s prior written consent. Licensor may assign this License in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.
