agent-base
==========
### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance
[](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async
callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the
given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.

#### Some subclasses:

Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.
Send a pull request to list yours!

 * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints
 * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints
 * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS

Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

Example
-------

Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server
for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):

Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:

Return another `http.Agent` instance to "pass through" the responsibility
for that HTTP request to that agent:

API
---

## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]

Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`
for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function
is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be
used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.

The `options` object accepts the following properties:

  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).

The callback function should have the following signature:

### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined

The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and
and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed
to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted
to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however
else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to
the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will
continue to proceed.

If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the
`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

electron-json-storage
=====================

> Easily write and read user settings in Electron apps

[](http://badge.fury.io/js/electron-json-storage)
[](https://david-dm.org/jviotti/electron-json-storage.svg)
[](https://travis-ci.org/electron-userland/electron-json-storage)
[](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/electron-userland/electron-json-storage/branch/master)

[Electron](http://electron.atom.io) lacks an easy way to persist and read user settings for your application. `electron-json-storage` implements an API somewhat similar to [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to write and read JSON objects to/from the operating system application data directory, as defined by `app.getPath('userData')`.

Related modules:

- [electron-settings](https://github.com/nathanbuchar/electron-settings)
- [electron-store](https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-store)
- [electron-storage](https://github.com/Cocycles/electron-storage)

Installation
------------

Install `electron-json-storage` by running:

You can require this module from either the **main** or **renderer** process (with and without `remote`).

Running on Electron >10 renderer processes
------------------------------------------

When loaded in renderer processes, this module will try to make use of
`electron.remote` in order to fetch the `userData` path.

Electron 10 now [defaults `enableRemoteModule` to
false](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/breaking-changes#default-changed-enableremotemodule-defaults-to-false),
which means that `electron-json-storage` will be able to calculate a data path by default.

The solution is to manually call `storage.setDataPath()` before reading or
writing any values or setting `enableRemoteModule` to `true`.

Documentation
-------------

    * [.getDefaultDataPath()](#module_storage.getDefaultDataPath) ⇒ <code>String</code> \| <code>Null</code>

    * [.getDataPath()](#module_storage.getDataPath) ⇒ <code>String</code>

<a name="module_storage.getDefaultDataPath"></a>

### storage.getDefaultDataPath() ⇒ <code>String</code> \| <code>Null</code>
This function will return `null` when running in the
renderer process without support for the `remote` IPC
mechanism. You have to explicitly set a data path using
`.setDataPath()` in these cases.

**Kind**: static method of [<code>storage</code>](#module_storage)  
**Summary**: Get the default data path  
**Returns**: <code>String</code> \| <code>Null</code> - default data path  
**Access**: public  
**Example**  

<a name="module_storage.setDataPath"></a>

### storage.setDataPath(directory)
The default value will be used if the directory is undefined.

**Kind**: static method of [<code>storage</code>](#module_storage)  
**Summary**: Set current data path  
**Access**: public  

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| directory | <code>String</code> \| <code>Undefined</code> | directory |

**Example**  

<a name="module_storage.getDataPath"></a>

### storage.getDataPath() ⇒ <code>String</code>
Returns the current data path. It defaults to a directory called
"storage" inside Electron's `userData` path.

**Kind**: static method of [<code>storage</code>](#module_storage)  
**Summary**: Get current user data path  
**Returns**: <code>String</code> - the user data path  
**Access**: public  
**Example**  

<a name="module_storage.get"></a>

### storage.get(key, [options], callback)
If the key doesn't exist in the user data, an empty object is returned.
Also notice that the `.json` extension is added automatically, but it's
ignored if you pass it yourself.

Passing an extension other than `.json` will result in a file created
with both extensions. For example, the key `foo.data` will result in a file
called `foo.data.json`.

Create new error instances with a code and additional properties.

The browser file is named index.umd.js which supports CommonJS, AMD and globals (errCode).

## Why

I find myself doing this repeatedly:

Simple usage.

## Pre-existing fields

If the passed `Error` already has a `.code` field, or fields specified in the third argument to `errcode` they will be overwritten, unless the fields are read only or otherwise throw during assignment in which case a new object will be created that shares a prototype chain with the original `Error`. The `.stack` and `.message` properties will be carried over from the original error and `.code` or any passed properties will be set on it.

`$ npm test`

- **Publisher:** Nathan Rajlich

### License Text
https-proxy-agent
================
### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS
[](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified
HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.

Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy"
server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to
open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.

Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other
protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).
See the "Examples" section below for more.

Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

Examples
--------

#### `https` module example

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

API
---

### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)

The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects
to the specified "HTTP(s) proxy server" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket
requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].

The `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an
"options" object with more specific properties:

  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.
  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.
  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.
  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.
  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.

### License Text
iMurmurHash.js
==============

An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).

This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.

Installation
------------

To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.

---

To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:

Then simply include it in your scripts:

Quick Example
-------------

Functions
---------

### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])
Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:

Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)
Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()
Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])
Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

# node-winreg #

node module that provides access to the Windows Registry through the REG commandline tool




The following command installs node-winreg.



If you prefer to install _without the development tools used to generate the HTML documentation_ (into a production environment for example) you should use the following command.



Note that the development dependencies will not be installed if this package was installed as a dependency of another package.




The documentation is generated using [jsdoc](http://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc "jsdoc Website") with the [docstrap template](http://docstrap.github.io/docstrap "docstrap website"). You can view the API documentation [online](http://fresc81.github.io/node-winreg "online documentation"), download the latest documentation or generate it from the sourcecode.


### Online Documentation ###

View the latest docs [online](http://fresc81.github.io/node-winreg "online documentation").


### Download Documentation ###

To download the latest docs from GIT the following command is used.




### Generate Documentation ###

To generate the docs from the sources you can use the following command.



Note that generating the docs requires the development dependencies to be installed.




Let's start with an example. The code below lists the autostart programs of the current user.



## Troubleshooting ##


### Access to restricted keys ###

Since Windows Vista access to certain Registry Hives (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or short HKLM for example) is restricted to processes that run in a security elevated context even if the user that starts the process is an admin. You can start a console within that context by right clicking the console shortcut and selecting the item with the shield icon called "Run as administrator" from the context menu.

Under some rare circumstances access to Registry Hives or particular keys may also be blocked by some antivirus programs or the Windows Group Policy Editor (google for gpedit.msc).

You can also use the regedit.exe tool shipped with Windows to check if you actually have access.


### Processing UTF-8 data ###

The Microsoft Windows console isn't capable of handling UTF-8 encoded text unless you set it up properly. If you see weird question marks for certain characters, it's probhably a problem with the encoding.

By default the console is setup to use an encoding that suits the language of the Windows operating system installation. Windows uses codepages to specify encodings for the console. The codepage is a unique number which is assigned to each encoding.

If you want to query the currently selected codepage you can type the command <code>chcp</code> (w/o parameters). To set a new codepage (UTF-8 for this example) you pass the codepage number as the only argument to <code>chcp</code>. The codepage value for UTF-8 is 65001.

You can easily do this from within your nodejs script by using the <code>child_process.execSync(...)</code> function like the following example shows.



An even better approach would be to extract and store the value returned by a call to <code>chcp</code> prior setting the console to UTF-8 and resetting the codepage after your script is done.

binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
